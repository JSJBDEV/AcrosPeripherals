# Acro's Peripherals
A CC: Tweaked addon

Originally this mod was intended to add more autonomy to turtles by allowing turtles to "reprogram" other turtles, then I realised you can already do this.

Turtles can place drives and edit disks, by default all computers will run  "startup.lua" from the root of a disk in a drive

But I do also think this repo is a good simple example of how to make turtle peripherals for 1.20.1

it took quite a while to figure out a "Minimum Viable Product" for turtle peripherals.
